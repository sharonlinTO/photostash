# Sharon's Photostash App

## About
The OG PhotoStash app no longer works on Slack, so I'm going to make a new one!!!

## Running the App
Make sure to add the Slackbot to your channel

## Running the Server
Using ngrok.exe, run the command: ```ngrok http 5000```
- Make sure that you update **Event Subscriptions** on the Slack API with endpoint in ngrok
- Make sure that you update **Request URL** under Slash commands with endpoint in ngrok
